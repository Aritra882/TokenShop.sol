### 🧩 Project Description
**TokenShop** is a smart contract that allows users to **buy ERC20 tokens using ETH**, powered by **Chainlink price feeds**.  
It fetches real-time ETH/USD prices to ensure accurate token pricing and integrates seamlessly with the **MyERC20 token contract**.  

This project is ideal for anyone learning how to connect **smart contracts, oracles, and ERC20 tokens** to build decentralized applications that respond to real-world data.

### 🚀 What It Does
- Accepts **ETH payments** from users.  
- Uses **Chainlink’s ETH/USD price feed** to calculate the current exchange rate.  
- Mints tokens for users based on the amount of ETH sent.  
- Lets the contract owner withdraw collected ETH securely.  
- Includes **error handling** for zero ETH transactions and failed withdrawals.
